## Using the travel site with Signals

Next up open the travel website in your browser at [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086). You should now see the homepage of the travel site loaded successfully.

Once the site is loaded, you can start interacting with it. Try searching for a destination, clicking through some of the filters in the left hand pane and viewing some different destinations or experiences.

Open the dev console (Ctrl+Shift+I) in your browser and open the Snowplow Inspector tab. Confirm that events are flowing through in the first tab before switching to the 'Attributes' tab. If you have not already setup the Signals connection in your Chrome Extension do so now through the options menu.

You should now see Attributes updating as you browse through the site.
